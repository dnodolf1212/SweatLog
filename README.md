# README

The SweatLog is an example of a fitness tracking application used to log individual workouts and their associted details. For the backend a Rails API stores and keeps track of these workouts and details. On the frontend, Javascript allows us to render a view of this data on a single page with a form to input a workout and buttons to toggle and submit the details form. To start the app, run bundle install to load any dependencies. CD to the sweat_log_api and run a server with the "rails server" command. Finally, open the app in the browser by navigating to sweat_log_frontend/src and run open index.html.
